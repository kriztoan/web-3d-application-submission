3d App Deeper Understandings Statement

When creating the 3d models, rather than using Blender or Maya at first, I used Cinema 4D to make my 3d renders and I thought they came out looking pretty good as seen in the c4d models tab of my submission.
From there, they were exported in an fxb file, which was then imported into Blender so that I could import into x3d. Before doing that I had to make sure that the materials were still on the can and the bottles when I exported, so I had to change the image texturing on Blender.
From there I exported into castle-model-viewer, which showed me a 3d render of what I had created, which would be similar to that of what was going into my website.
From there, I downloaded the x3d file and changed some of the code so that the materials would still be visible. Originally, there was a material piece of code, which was blocking all of the materials from coming through.
I deleted that then added an ImageTexture function, adding the correct file name to make sure the texture was coming up on the model, as seen below.
